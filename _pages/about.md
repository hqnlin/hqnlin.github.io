Hello, my name is **Hanlin Xie** (Tony), I am a first year **Electrical and Electronic Engineering** student at the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/engineering/departments/eee/index.aspx) in the UK. I’m most engaged when it comes to real-word projects since I learn best through practical, hands-on experience.

One of my favourite modules so far is the **Applied Construction Project**, where I got to design and develop an **autonomous vehicle** through various methods from using IR sensors for line following to using OpenCV for image recognition and connecting other theories learned in other parts of the course.

Outside of academics, I enjoy going to the gym and recently picked up calisthenics. I'm also exploring small electronics projects and learning to turn ideas into working systems.

I'm open to new experiences, collaboration, and any learning opportunities that come my way.
